Intro: I'm a Chemist working on drug design. I've been working on docking, binding affinity calculation since my college project. 
I've been digging in nature inspired algorithms and its applicability on drug design.
I also love Phisical Chemistry in general. In my free time I like to write some hopefully useful programs.
